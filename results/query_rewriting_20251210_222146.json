      "expected": "To augment LLM responses with retrieved external knowledge to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations",
      "actual": "A RAG system primarily focuses on improving the retrieval stage of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging various techniques to enhance information extraction and utilization. Its core objective is to provide more accurate and relevant information for LLMs to answer complex tasks during the inference stage.\n\nThe primary objectives of a RAG system include:\n\n1. Enhancing knowledge extraction: To improve the ability of LLMs to extract relevant information from large datasets, making them more capable of handling complex tasks.\n2. Augmenting model capabilities: By incorporating various techniques, such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to further enhance the capabilities of LLMs in specific domains or tasks.\n3. Fostering flexible adaptation: To enable RAG systems to adapt to continuously updated knowledge and changing environments, making them more robust and effective.\n\nBy achieving these objectives, RAG systems aim to significantly improve the overall performance and effectiveness of LLMs in various applications.",

      "question": "What are the main components of a RAG system?",
      "expected": "A retriever (to find relevant documents) and a generator (LLM to produce answers using retrieved context)",
      "actual": "An RAG system typically consists of multiple components. These include retrievers, which are algorithms designed to search through large datasets or databases to identify relevant information or answers. Generators, on the other hand, are used to create coherent and meaningful responses from the retrieved information.\n\nAugmentations also play a crucial role in RAG systems as they enhance or modify the output of the generators to improve its quality and relevance. This could involve techniques such as text ranking, relevance scoring, or even post-processing to refine the generated content.\n\nOther components that are often part of an RAG system include data preprocessing and filtering mechanisms, which help prepare the input data for processing by the retriever and generator. Additionally, evaluation metrics and frameworks are essential in assessing the performance of RAG systems and providing a standardized way to measure their effectiveness.",

      "question_id": "semantic_02",
      "question": "What is the difference between RAGAS and traditional RAG evaluation?",
      "expected": "RAGAS is an automated evaluation framework that measures faithfulness, answer relevance, and context precision/recall, whereas traditional evaluation often relies on manual human assessment",
      "actual": "The main difference between RAGAS and traditional RAG assessment methodologies lies in their approach to evaluation. Traditional RAG assessments focus primarily on task-specific metrics such as Hit Rate, MRR, and NDCG for retrieval quality, while BLEU and ROUGE scores are used for generation quality. In contrast, RAGAS employs a more comprehensive evaluation framework that incorporates traditional metrics with additional criteria, such as faithfulness, relevance, non-harmfulness, accuracy, and robustness. This customized approach aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of the model's capabilities across various evaluation aspects.",
